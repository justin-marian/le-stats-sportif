# Unit Tests

- Suite tests designed to verify the functionality of each API endpoint in the web server.
- For each endpoint, the tests send specific input data, retrieve the job result, and compare it to a reference output.
- Ensure that the server responses correct to requests, maintaining consistent and accurate behavior across various scenarios.
